      <p>Download the NICS Android mobile application from the NICS server at: <a href="http://public.nics.ll.mit.edu/app/NICSMobile.apk" target="_blank">http://public.nics.ll.mit.edu/app/NICSMobile.apk</a></p>
      <p>Download the NICS Apple mobile application from the Apple Appstore at: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nics-mobile/id985324130?mt=8" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nics-mobile/id985324130?mt=8</a></p>

    <p>The best way to do this is to copy and paste this link in an email to the mobile device you intent to install the application on. </p>
    <p>It is also important to ensure that your phone settings allow the installation of 3rd party applications.</p>
    <p>Please  remember that NICS Mobile requires a valid email account username (legacy NICS  usernames that are not email addresses will not work).</p>
    <p>Also note that these screen shots were taken with a Samsung Galaxy Tablet, your aspect ratio may make the displays seem slightly different.</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td><p>Once the application is downloaded and installed you will find it in your applications. Feel free to drag the icon to a more accessible location, such as your main display.</p>
    <p>If you are re-installing or installing a new version of the application it is best practice to uninstall the older version. If you do not do this it may cause a crash on loading the new application.</p>
    <p>If you are not certain which version you have you can find out by going to your phone settings and selecting NICS from the list under Application Manager. The version is provided at the top.</p></td>

    <td>Loading the application will display the splash screen and version number. </td>

  <tr>
    <td><p>As previously mentioned, the NICS mobile application requires a valid login with email address.</p>
    <p>Enter your user name and password. </p>
    <p>If this is your personal device it is recommended that you check &quot;remember username&quot;.</p>
    <p>If you typically frequent the same NICS server then check &quot;automatically login&quot;.</p>
    <p>Select which workspace you wish to log into: Incident (for actual events) or Training (for testing and training). </p>
    <p>Note if you do NOT wish to log into the NICS Production server hosted at the San Diego Super Computer Center in CA, you may select a different server by selecting the wrench icon in the upper right.</p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Pressing the &quot;Sign in&quot; button connects the mobile device to the selected server with the username and password provided.</p>
    <p>The mobile application will then load the available incidents and collaboration rooms. Note that archived incidents are not available. Also note that the mobile application cannot create new incidents or collaboration rooms.</p>
