<h1><u>Admin Overview</u></h1>

<p>As NICS grows, more and more administrators will need to be trained in 
order to manage organizations. The role of the Admin will be to monitor 
incidents and rooms, approve accounts for new users, and general administrative 
duties.</p>

<p>The rest of this help site aims to help new administrators understand 
their additional capabilities, as well as gain a better understanding on 
how NICS is organized.</p>

<p>This section is a work in progress.</p>
