<h1>Locking the Room</h1>

<p>In a collaborative environment, it is important to control who 
can input and when they can input. Locking the room is one way to 
control the room environment.</p>
<p>The lock can be found under the navigation controls on the left.

</div>
<p>Locking a room prevents the map from being edited (moving, 
creating, or deleting objects) but you may still navigate freely 
and apply/remove data layers</p>
