<h1>Video Outlines</h1>

<h2>Incidents and Rooms</h2>
<p>NICS uses a 2 level structure to organize its workspaces between 
users. When you first log into NICS, you are not a member of any 
workspaces.</p>
<p>To join one, open the incidents menu from the main 
bar, and choose one from the drop down list. Notice how the incident 
name appears in the bar, indicating your membership. Each incident 
has several workspaces, known as rooms, to further organize each 
incident. Joining a room is similar to joining an incident, just 
choose from the drop down menu on the left. You may also create your 
own room or incident by selecting the option in their respective 
menus. Just fill out the dialog and hit enter.</p>
<p>When you enter a room, it appears as a tab in the rooms bar, after 
any other rooms you are currently subscribed to. A personal “My Map” 
room is independent of incidents; it is always available for your use. 
Use it to draft a sketch before sharing it with others</p>

<h2>Windows and Panels</h2>
<p>Your workspace is valuable, and you may want to clear out panels
that you are not using. For the map area, you may close open windows 
by clicking on the x in the top right corner. You may also hide 
all windows by selecting the option in the tools menu. These may be 
shown again by selecting the show all windows button. To clear up 
the top bar, you can leave rooms by clicking on the x next to their
name. Finally, you can also hide and show the side and chat panels by 
clicking on their respective bars.</p>

<h2>Main Toolbar</h2>
<p>Most manipulations in NICS can be accessed from the main toolbar. 
Drag/Select similar, but can pan map with drag</p>
<p>SKIP FOUR, talk about in other video. Then undo redo copy paste</p>

<h2>Navigating the Map</h2>
<p>The intuitive map interface is easy to use even for first time 
users.</p>
<p>MOVING THE MAP: corner arrows, pan tool.</p>
<p>ZOOMING: corner lenses, zoom box, scroll wheel.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW MAP: opening</p>

<h2>Drawing</h2>
<p>Drawing on the map is the fastest and easiest way to distribute 
situational awareness to users of the NICS system.</p>
<p>Stamp/rotate, then polygon, then pen thickness</p>

<h2>Object Manipulation</h2>

<h2>Data Layers</h2>
<p>Separating information out into data layers allows users to recall 
information on demand as it is needed.</p>
<p>Data Layers window, describe base (overall look and feel) and data 
(overlaid information)difference. Range from static (boundaries) to 
live (AVL) feeds. For example, look at fire history for CA. If it is 
the first time, loading may take a few seconds. Data layers are 
powerful and can be expanded on.</p>

<h2>Locking the Room</h2>
<p>The information on the map is valuable, so you want to make sure it 
is not accidentally altered.</p>
<p>Draw, lock the room, try to draw, unlock the room, draw.</p>

<h2>Chat</h2>
<p>While drawing is useful, some ideas are best conveyed through the 
text instant messaging provided in each room</p>
<p>Typing message, enter. Room status lights, user information</p>

<h2>Active Users</h2>
<p>You can check on the availability of other users on the "active 
users" tab in the right panel.</p>
<p>Open it, click the tab. Columns. Private chat capability</p>

<h2>Share My Map</h2>
<p>If you want to show everyone the same map you are seeing, you may 
do so temporarily by using the share my map button. (explination). In 
order to permanently display your map in another room, just use the 
copy paste functionality</p>

<h2>Map Sync</h2>
<p>Merge with above?</p>
<p>It is also beneficial to move others to where you are looking</p>

<h2>Import/Export .kml</h2>
