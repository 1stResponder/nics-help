It enables robust collaboration and coordination among the highly fragmented and diverse disaster response entities that respond to large-scale disasters. Information can be shared quickly between different groups through separate workspaces. It is designed for use in large and extreme scale incidents, involving up to tens of thousands of first responders Sharing methods run on a plugin model, current modules include: Shared Whiteboards Chatting (public and private) Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) Forms and Reports The NICS interface NICS is the all purpose solution for multi-headed operations, it is the one channel for all information to go through. Some applications include fire control, marathon tracking, police chases, etc. Throughout this tutorial, you will be viewing videos and diagrams that will increase your familiarity of the interface and get you to use it quickly and efficiently NICS was created by MIT Lincoln Laboratory under sponsorship by the Department of Homeland Security''s Science and Technology Directorate.
